                    LUKJAN METAL PRODUCTS is a family owned and operated business that has been manufacturing high quality sheet metal pipe, 
                    duct and fittings for the wholesale HVAC industry since February, 1964.  
                    Its flagship facility is located in Conneaut, Ohio, just one-hour east of Cleveland Ohio, and boasts over 270,000 square feet of
                    manufacturing capacity serving the northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets.  In October 2006, LUKJAN expanded operations into
                    Kings Mountain, North Carolina, just outside of Charlotte, looking to take advantage of the high growth potential in the
                    southeastern states.  This greenfield facility added another 240,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity and today is a
                    vibrant and growing facility despite its opening prior to one of the worst housing markets and recessions in the country. 
                    Lukjanâ€™s next move was the acquisition of Midwest Ducts located in Prairie Farm, Wisconsin, in March, 2016, capturing an 
                    entirely new service area. Recognizing similar growth opportunities in the western states, Lukjan Metal Products opened 
                    another greenfield operation, August 2017, in Sidney, Nebraska boasting over 190,000 square feet of space. 
                    Filling that space with equipment was the next challenge that was satisfied by an asset purchase of equipment from the 
                    Gary Metal manufacturing facility in Gary, Indiana in March 2018.  With its expanded footprint, Lukjan Metal Products 
                    today is positioned as one of the leading manufacturers of prefabricated sheet metal fittings in the United States.
                    LUKJAN was founded by Anatol and Natalie Lukjanczuk in 1964 in a small garage in Conneaut, OH, following the guiding 
                    principles of providing high quality sheet metal products at competitive prices backed by extraordinary customer service. 
                    These principles continue today under the direction and leadership of son Dan Lukjanczuk and daughter Elena Lukjanczuk-Kelly 
                    where LUKJAN continues to expand into new markets while maintaining a highly efficient operation without sacrificing service 
                    and attention to customer needs. So whether your company is a fully established HVAC distributor with multiple branch locations 
                    and multi-million dollar sales or a new HVAC distributor looking to grow your business, look to LUKJAN METAL PRODUCTS for the 
                    finest in high quality sheet metal products backed by the best service in the business.
